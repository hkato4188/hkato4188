- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Hiro. 
- I currently carry the titles of teacher and fullstack developer but consider myself to be more of a student.
- Fueled by coffee, curiosity, and collaboration, I welcome any opportunity to learn and help out.
- After all, the web connects more than machines; it connects people.
